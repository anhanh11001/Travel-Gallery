<img src="https://i.ibb.co/CWNdXgp/logo.png" width="150">

### Warning
This project is <b>deprecated</b> now. This was one of my first Android project in which I explored a lot of things about Android. It was a beginner application, which contains tons of bugs, code smells, bad coding practices. I am working on a completely better version of this app. Please check out this [link](https://github.com/anhanh11001/-UPGRADE-Travel-Gallery) here.

### Description
This is my personal travel gallery app, one of my favorite apps that I have built myself. This app helps me to store all of my travel story, images and create custom albums/themes. It took me nearly 3 weeks to finish and polish this app.

### Features
Some of the features of the app are:
- All the basic features of a normal photo gallery apps: store/display/delete photos, tag photos by food/people/favorite.
- Creating custom albums.
- Settings custom themes, sort photos based on time or shuffle randomly.
- Editing photos information: title, description, time, location.
- Creating custom travel stories.
- Tagging photos on map based on location, counting number of cities and countries you have visited to create a list of travel places.
- Dark Mode
