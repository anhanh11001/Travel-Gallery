# Travel-Gallery
![Travel Gallery Logo](https://i.ibb.co/CWNdXgp/logo.png)

### Description
This is my personal travel gallery app, one of my favorite apps that I have built myself. This app helps me to store all of my travel story, images and create custom albums/themes. It took me nearly 3 weeks to finish and polish this app.

### Features
Some of the features of the app are:
- All the basic features of a normal photo gallery apps: store/display/delete photos, tag photos by food/people/favorite.
- Creating custom albums.
- Settings custom themes, sort photos based on time or shuffle randomly.
- Editing photos information: title, description, time, location.
- Creating custom travel stories.
- Tagging photos on map based on location, counting number of cities and countries you have visited to create a list of travel places.
